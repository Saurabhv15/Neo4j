# Neo4j Practice – Movie Dataset Project

This folder contains my **practice work using Neo4j**, where I explored basic concepts of graph databases by creating a small movie dataset with actors and genres.

## 🔧 What I Practiced

- Installing and setting up **Neo4j Desktop**
- Writing **Cypher queries** to:
  - Create nodes for movies, genres, and actors
  - Create relationships like *HAS_GENRE* and *ACTED_IN*
  - Match and fetch data for visualisation
- Understanding **graph data modelling** to represent interconnected data
- Visualising data connections using **Neo4j Browser**

---

## 💡 Purpose

I did this practice to:

- Understand how **graph databases differ from relational databases**
- Learn to model real-world datasets as **graphs**
- Build a strong foundation for **recommendation systems, social networks, and knowledge graph applications**

✏️ **Note:**  
These files are part of my **personal learning practice** and can be used as references by beginners starting with Neo4j and Cypher queries.
