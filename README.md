# 🎬 Movie Genre Knowledge Graph with Neo4j

This project demonstrates how to model, query, and visualize a movie genre knowledge graph using Neo4j, a powerful graph database platform. By leveraging the relationships between movies and their associated genres, this notebook helps uncover insightful patterns using graph theory.

## 📌 Project Objective

The aim of this project is to build a simple **Movie Genre Knowledge Graph** that:
- Represents movies as nodes
- Connects them to genres using relationships
- Enables graph-based querying and visualization

This project showcases my hands-on experience with Neo4j and Cypher queries using Python. It is part of my journey to becoming a [Neo4j Certified Professional](https://graphacademy.neo4j.com/certifications/neo4j-certification/).

## 📊 Visual Output

Here is a snapshot of the resulting graph:

## 📁 Files

- `Knowledge_graph.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing the code, data creation, Cypher queries, and graph visualization using `py2neo` and `networkx`.
- `visualisation.png`: Rendered graph image showing relationships between genres and movie titles.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Neo4j Desktop / AuraDB**
- **Cypher Query Language**
- **Python (py2neo, NetworkX, matplotlib)**

## 📈 Graph Schema

The graph is structured as follows:
- Nodes:
  - 🎬 Movie Titles (e.g., *Toy Story*, *GoldenEye*)
  - 🧩 Genres (e.g., *Action*, *Comedy*, *Drama*)
- Relationships:
  - `:HAS_GENRE`

## 🧠 Learning Outcome

This project demonstrates:
- Real-world application of Neo4j for knowledge modeling
- Querying complex relationships through Cypher
- Use of Python to automate graph creation and manipulation
- Data visualization using NetworkX

## 📣 Contribution to the Neo4j Ecosystem

This GitHub repository stands as a public demonstration of my personal project using Neo4j. It reflects genuine hands-on experience (not AI-generated) and aligns with the requirements to redeem the Neo4j Certified Professional t-shirt reward.
